- [ ] `/chart/[id]` - Display calculated birth chart
- [ ] `/chart/[id]/edit` - Edit chart details

**Components to Build:**
- [ ] Birth data input form with location search
- [ ] Interactive birth chart visualization (D3.js/Canvas)
- [ ] Planet position display
- [ ] House cusp information
- [ ] Aspect grid/table

#### 3. User Authentication & Profiles
- [ ] Complete NextAuth.js setup with Google/GitHub providers
- [ ] User dashboard for saved charts
- [ ] Chart sharing and privacy settings
- [ ] User preferences (house system, orbs, etc.)

#### 4. Chart Visualization
**Key Components:**

- [ ] Planetary symbols and positions
- [ ] House divisions and numbers
- [ ] Aspect lines with different colors/styles
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile devices

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Swiss Ephemeris Integration
```typescript
// Example integration approach
import { calculatePlanetPosition } from '@/lib/swisseph'

export async function calculateBirthChart(birthData: BirthData) {
  const julianDay = dateToJulian(birthData.date)
  
  const planets = await Promise.all(
    PLANET_LIST.map(async (planet) => {
      const position = await calculatePlanetPosition(planet, julianDay)
      return {
        name: planet,
        longitude: position.longitude,
        latitude: position.latitude,
        // ... other properties
      }
    })
  )
  
  return { planets, houses, aspects }
}
```

#### Chart Visualization with D3.js
```typescript
// Birth chart component structure
export function BirthChartWheel({ chart }: { chart: BirthChart }) {
  const svgRef = useRef<SVGSVGElement>(null)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!svgRef.current) return
    
    const svg = d3.select(svgRef.current)
    
    // Draw zodiac wheel
    drawZodiacWheel(svg)
    
    // Draw house divisions
    drawHouses(svg, chart.houses)
    
    // Draw planets
    drawPlanets(svg, chart.planets)
    
    // Draw aspects
    drawAspects(svg, chart.aspects)
  }, [chart])
  
  return <svg ref={svgRef} width={400} height={400} />
}
```
